# Operating Systems

Typhoon supports [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/coreos/) and [Flatcar Linux](https://www.flatcar-linux.org/). These operating systems were chosen because they offer:

* Minimalism and focus on clustered operation
* Automated and atomic operating system upgrades
* Declarative and immutable configuration
* Optimization for containerized applications

Together, they diversify Typhoon to support a range of container technologies.

* Fedora CoreOS: rpm-ostree, podman, moby
* Flatcar Linux: Gentoo core, rkt-fly, docker
